# Hello-World
1st repository
I am a strong arts and design professional with a Bachelors of Science, Mass Communications with a concentration in Creative Advertising and a Master's Certificate focused in Project Management from The George Washington University.

I loves making both wearable and non-wearable art. Custom handmade jewelry, graphic design, digital conversions and art is what I do! LMDesigns is here to service those wanting and needing the expertise of a freelance designer.
